## Galactice Snake

*Galactic Snake* was originally developed as part of the Midwestern State University ACM Chapter's Spring 2021 Game Jam. It was built in Phaser 3 (JavaScript) with a Firebase backend to manage authentication and the score table. I have made a few small updates since because I am very fond of the project.
