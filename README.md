## Resume
If you wish to see an updated overview of my skills and work experience, [visit my Resume](/Resume/) page, which should generally stay up to date.

## Portfolio
You can find the many of my public projects on [my Dev Projects page](/DevProjects/). Not all of my professional work can be publicly shared,
unfortunately, but if you wish to inquire regarding other projects listed on my resume you may contact me directly so that we may discuss them.

_This site is still a work-in-progress. I haven't had the time to develop a full personal site just yet (I've been working!) but I plan to soon! (This one is just generated from a markdown README) If there is any information you need, contact me at [jeremyglebe@gmail.com](mailto:jeremyglebe@gmail.com)_
