## Graph Representation
This project was completed for 5243 Algorithm Analysis. The assignment was to write code to represent graphs as an adjacency matrix and as an adjacency list.

## Hashing Experiment
In 5243 Algorithm Analysis we were instructed to write a program demonstrating comparisons in efficiency and collision frequency for different types of hashing. (Linear probing, double hashing)

## Binary Search Trees vs AVL Trees
This program compares the performance of an unbalanced binary search tree vs an AVL balanced binary search tree. The program was written for 3013 Advanced Algorithms while I was an undergraduate.

## Spanning Trees
Written for 3013 Advanced Algorithms during my undergraduate. The program generates a graph of cities in the united states and connects them using a spanning tree. (It also checks how complete the graph is and includes that in output)
