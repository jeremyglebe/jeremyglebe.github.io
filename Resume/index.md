## Summary
I have been programming in JavaScript for over 7 years and am proficient with and without modern frameworks. I have 3 years of professional experience developing Angular and Vue web applications, as well as some work on native mobile apps. I am an educator with experience teaching 5th grade all the way through college seniors. This has provided me much insight on collaborative learning and cooperative development. I am considering positions in software development, education, or a combination of the two.
