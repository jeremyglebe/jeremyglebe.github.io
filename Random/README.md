## Insult Generator
So, my class of 5th and 6th graders was making a pretty silly insult generator project to learn about arrays. (Inspired by Nick Morgan's book, "JavaScript for Kids") I decided to make my own version. Then I decided to add emojis. Then cycling insults and a pause feature and - well it got out of hand. Enjoy!
